ELT Project Technical Report

The goal of this project was to find data, clean/transform said data and then place it into a database. The data sets that we selected for this task were building ordinance violation in the city of Chicago and US census data. This would enable a consumer of the end product to be able to query the database in order to gain insights into the relationships between population and building violations in the various Chicago zip codes.

Data Utilised

Both datasets came from "Kaggle.com" in the form of CSV files, and both contained extremely large amounts of data (> 200MB each) and hence some initial filtering down had to be done outside of the task as the files could not be uploaded into GitHub as they were. In order to satisfy the GitHub requirements Excel was used to trim both datasets down to just the data relevant to 2010 prior to performing the tasks required by then exercise.
